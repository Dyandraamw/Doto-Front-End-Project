IN THIS CASE, EACH TEAM IS COMPOSED OF FIVE PLAYERS EACH WHO WIN THE MATCH BY DESTROYING THE OPPOSING TEAM'S ANCIENT BUILDING BEFORE THEY CAN DESTROY YOURS, AND AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT, THIS IS LOCATED AS FAR INTO ENEMY TERRITORY AS CAN BE. <br>
                    <br> THREE LANES WILL SPAWN ENDLESS WAVES OF CREEPS ON BOTH SIDES THAT PROVIDE EXPERIENCE, AND HELP PUSH AGAINST THE OTHER BUILDINGS ALONG THE WAY, WHICH INCLUDE EFFIGIES, BARRACKS, SHRINES, AND TOWERS.

                <p class="paragraph">THE MENTIONED BUILDINGS ALL PLAY DIFFERENT ROLES AS THE MATCH PROGRESSES. TOWERS WORK TO DEFEND IMPORTANT STRUCTURES, AND THE DEEPER INTO THE 
                    OPPOSING TERRITORY ONE GOES, THE HIGHER TIER THEY ARE. <br> <br> TIER 1 IS THE LOWEST FORM AND THE FIRST THAT ONE ENCOUNTERS, AND DEFENDING THE ANCIENT ARE TWO TIER 4 TOWERS,
                     WHICH FAR MORE ARMOR, HIT POINTS, AND DAMAGE DEALING POTENTIAL. DESTROYING THESE IN EACH
                     LANE IS NECESSARY BOTH FOR THE ADVANTAGE IT PROVIDES IN HAVING CREEPS PROGRESS TOWARDS THE ENEMY STRUCTURES WITHOUT RESISTANCE, AND FOR THE EXPERIENCE THEY PROVIDE.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">THERE ARE FIVE HEROES ON EACH TEAM, AND THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT ROLES THAT EVERY TEAM NEEDS TO COVER: TWO SUPPORTS (POSITIONS FOUR AND FIVE), 
                    OFFLANER (POSITION THREE),
                     MID (POSITION TWO), AND CARRY (POSITION ONE). THE ROLE YOU PLAY IN EACH MATCH DETERMINES WHICH LANE YOU BEGIN IN, AND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF YOU THROUGHOUT THE GAME. <br> <br>
                     THE POSITION FIVE SUPPORT BEGINS THE GAME IN THE SAFE LANE (THAT'S BOTTOM FOR RADIANT, TOP FOR DIRE) ALONGSIDE THE POSITION ONE CARRY. THE POSITION FOUR AND THE OFFLANER HANG OUT TOGETHER IN THE OFFLANE (BOTTOM FOR DIRE, TOP FOR RADIANT) AND THE MID GOES... WELL,
                      NO PRIZES FOR GUESSING WHERE.

                <p class="paragraph">CREEPS - NON-HERO UNITS - ARE THE MAIN SOURCE OF GOLD AND EXPERIENCE IN THE GAME. WHEN A CREEP DIES, IT GIVES EXPERIENCE TO ITS NEARBY ENEMIES.
                     CRUCIALLY, YOU ONLY GET GOLD FROM THE CREEP IF YOU DELIVER THE KILLING BLOW, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE LAST HIT. YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE HEALTH BAR CAREFULLY AND EYEBALL 
                     THE EXACT MOMENT TO THWACK THE CREEP SO YOU CAN SECURE THIS, WHICH IS A SKILL ALL ON ITS OWN. YOU CAN ALSO LAST HIT YOUR 
                    OWN FRIENDLY CREEPS TO PREVENT YOUR ENEMIES FROM GETTING THE MONEY FROM THE LAST HIT, WHILE ALSO HALVING THE EXPERIENCE THEY GET FROM THE CREEP.
                     THIS IS CALLED DENYING. </p>
